## Analysis Overview
The goal of this study was to construct two tables: one to determine **the number of retiring employees by their job titles**, and the other to identify employees who would benefit to participate in a **mentorship program**. We included information like *employee number, first and laswname, position title, and start and finish dates* in the first table. We added the *employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and finish dates, and position title* to the second sheet.

## Results
### Deliverable 1 - The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
You can find the first table here: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/NedaAJ/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

## Summary of results
- Senior Engineers account for over a third of the retirees, with the rest of the Senior Staff accounting for the remaining third. 
- As a result, when it comes to determining which positions to fill, the organization should prioritize Senior
Engineer and Senior Staff positions.
- There are 1,549 employees who qualify for the mentorship program among those who are retiring.
- There are more people retiring than there are possible mentors, requiring the organization to devise a cost-effective program to address the gap between the number of people leaving and the number of people who can be taught to fill these roles.

## Summary
- For future, we can divide the retirees into age groups and make a graph. If the retirement age is 65, the company can hire (internally or externally) the number of people who would be retiring each year. We currently have a list of individuals born between 1952 and 1955. As a result, each of the next four years' hiring quotas would be different.
- We don't have enough retirees to mentor the next generation of employees, based on current estimates of possible mentors and the number of individuals retiring. We can now design a query that returns a list of people who will be retiring at the end of the current year (and for each following year). The organization can then determine how many younger staff will need to be trained to fill the vacant roles. It would also be helpful if we could develop a query that categorizes mentor-eligible employees by job titles which can be used by organization to organize the mentorship program, including how many mentees a mentor can take on to fill the retirement vacancies.
